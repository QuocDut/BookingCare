(4, 'Doctor: Hary Pham', '\n### Specialist in internal medicine\n\nMain article:  [Internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\")\n\nAround the world the term physician refers to a  [specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialist \"Medical specialist\")  in  [internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\")  or one of its many sub-specialties (especially as opposed to a specialist in  [surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery \"Surgery\")). This meaning of physician conveys a sense of expertise in treatment by drugs or medications, rather than by the procedures of  [surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon \"Surgeon\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-Fowler-4)\n\nThis term is at least nine hundred years old in English: physicians and surgeons were once members of separate professions, and traditionally were rivals. The  _[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorter_Oxford_English_Dictionary \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\")_, third edition, gives a  [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English \"Middle English\")  quotation making this contrast, from as early as 1400: \"O Lord, whi is it so greet difference betwixe a cirugian and a physician.\"[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-newSOED-5)\n\n[Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England \"Henry VIII of England\")  granted a charter to the London  [Royal College of Physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians \"Royal College of Physicians\")  in 1518. It was not until 1540 that he granted the  [Company of Barber-Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon \"Barber surgeon\")  (ancestor of the  [Royal College of Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons \"Royal College of Surgeons\")) its separate charter. In the same year, the English monarch established the  [Regius Professorship of Physic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Physic_(Cambridge) \"Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)\")  at the  [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge \"University of Cambridge\").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-6)  Newer universities would probably describe such an academic as a professor of  [internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\"). Hence, in the 16th century,  _physic_  meant roughly what internal medicine does now.\n\nCurrently, a specialist  [physician in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_in_the_United_States \"Physician in the United States\")  may be described as an  _internist_. Another term,  _[hospitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalist \"Hospitalist\")_, was introduced in 1996,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-7)  to describe US specialists in  [internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\")  who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such \'hospitalists\' now make up about 19% of all US  _general internists_,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-8)  who are often called  _general physicians_  in  [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_nations \"Commonwealth of nations\")  countries.\n\nThis original use, as distinct from surgeon, is common in most of the world including the  [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\")  and other Commonwealth countries (such as  [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"),  [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh \"Bangladesh\"),  [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India \"India\"),  [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"),  [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\"),  [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"),  [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka \"Sri Lanka\"), and  [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe \"Zimbabwe\")), as well as in places as diverse as  [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\"),  [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\"),  [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\"),  [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"),  [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\"), and  [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\").
